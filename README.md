# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-ANN
Handwritten Digit Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) involves training a model to recognize and classify handwritten digits, typically from 0 to 9. The ANN learns patterns from labeled datasets, allowing it to generalize and accurately identify handwritten digits in unseen data.
